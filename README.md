Disaster Management in itself is a tedious task for the government and authorities. It requires other people to take initiatives from their sides and aid the government in the process, by helping each other. One such area which requires a lot of attention and help is the post-disaster psychological aid required by disaster-affected people.

## Main Idea Description
We have thought of creating a web application which helps the disaster-affected people recover psychologically from trauma by hosting live video sessions/recorded sessions (using WebRTC APIs)  by trained and certified psychologists who are willing to volunteer to contribute in some manner. We do so by inviting applications from the psychologists through a form. Then, as soon as verification is done, an event is created to notify people of the session. We also keep the recorded sessions for future use. Also, if people find sessions really helpful, they can donate to the trainer through our money transfer service. 

## Features 
### Live/Recorded Video Sessions
Live/Recorded Sessions for people by trained and certified psychologists to recover from post-disaster trauma. 
### Blog Space
A blog writing forum/space for people to express their views/ share their experiences on how they tackled the disaster or what went wrong from their side. This will also help them recover faster and better and be helpful for other people. 

## What after the hackathon

We think that even though the application we build is a part of the hackthon process, we would like to work upon it even after it and make it better and more feature-rich. Also, if we are not able to implement some features right now, we would continue with the development after the hackathon. 
Also, we think that physical sessions would benefit the people a lot. So, using our platform to conduct community driven physical sessions is also a goal that we would like to achieve.
