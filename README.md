Disaster Management in itself is a tedious task for the government and authorities. It requires other people to take initiatives from their sides and aid the government in the process, by helping each other. One such area which requires a lot of attention and help is the post-disaster psychological aid required by disaster-affected people.

## Main Idea Description
We have thought of creating a web application which helps the disaster-affected people recover psychologically from trauma by becoming a medium to conduct sessions at a nearby place by trained and certified psychologists who are willing to volunteer to contribute in some manner. We do so by inviting applications from the psychologists through a form. Then, as soon as verification is done, an event is created to notify people of the session. People register themselves and if there is sufficient amount of participation, a venue can be decided where this session can be held. This will completely be a community driven initiative where we are providing a platform for event set-up, scheduling and notifying. We also aim to record the sessions and host them on our app for future use. Also, if people find sessions really helpful, they can donate to the speaker through our money transfer service. 

## Features
### Community Driven Sessions
Registering volunteers, registering people, setting-up and scheduling sessions, and notifying people for the face-to-face sessions by trained and certified psychologists to recover from post-disaster trauma. 
### Recorded Sessions
Recorded sessions will be hosted on our website 
### Blog Space
A blog writing forum/space for people to express their views/ share their experiences on how they tackled the disaster or what went wrong from their side. This will also help them recover faster and better and be helpful for other people.
